We first gathered the traffic images from https://www.511pa.com/CameraListing.aspx using traffic cameras at 6 different intersections in the Greater Philadelphia area: US-1 @ PA-23, US-1 Btwn Henry Ave & Scotts Ln, US-1 @ Fox St, US-1 @ Wissahickon Ave, US-1 @ Roberts Ave, and US-1 @ 17th St. We took 50 screenshots from the live feed of each camera at approximately 2 second intervals, making sure to record the order of the screenshots by naming the image files img1, img2, etc.
